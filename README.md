# what is it?
 The equation solver will be run from the command line and will only
work with integer numbers, multiple variable (X) and the following arithmetic
operators: + - * /.
For example, if the C# program is compiled to Equ.exe, the following demonstrates
how it will appear in the command line:
calc 3X - 9 = 6x + 8
X = -5

# How to use this?
Execute from command line and run in this form
Equ.exe calc + equation
eg: Equ.exe calc 3x+5=6x-9
